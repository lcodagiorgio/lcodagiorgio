## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luca, I have a Master's in Data Science and Business Informatics (@UniPi) and a Bachelor's in Business Administration (@UniFi), and I'm deeply passionate in all things Python, Data Science and Machine Learning!

- âš¡ I recently built a framework to validate the realism of LLM-powered simulators and to evaluate alteration effects, i.e. those obtained by modified configurations of the systems (counterfactual streams), on their original, unaltered outputs.
  - [SIMVALE](https://github.com/lcodagiorgio/SIMVALE) (SIMulator VAlidation with Latent Embeddings) was actually my Master Thesis work!
- ðŸŒ± Among the repos you can find some of the most relevant projects related to my degree, such as:
  - Optimization ([here](https://github.com/lcodagiorgio/ODS_project-repo))
  - Statistics ([here](https://github.com/lcodagiorgio/SDS_project-repo))
  - Laboratory of Data Science ([here](https://github.com/lcodagiorgio/LDS_project-repo))
- ðŸ‘¯ Inspired and motivated by new challenges, I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded peers and organizations to make a lasting impact on both business performance and society at large!
